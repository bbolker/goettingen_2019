- deal with singular fit warnings in boot/augment/influence
- temp repo for extras?
- use allFit from package rather than source?

* GLMM intro
    * pictures of X, Z for random-int, random-slopes models?
	* fix stier fig (tidy?)
* find/update/post Banta example? (ecostats chapter?)
	
* repo?  fix up
* clean up data? use rds/csv, read automatically and get obs/group numbers?
* allFit: return SEs of fixed effects? plot method???

* auto-scaling/centering of variables
* compare R^2 results across packages ...

* **look at merTools predict vignette!!**

* more on prediction issues
    * conditional vs marginal (integrate, simulate, delta method, closed-form)
    * exact conditional vs "partial conditional" (draw from cond sample) vs pop
	* variance in
	* importance sampling

* easier multi-group membership models?
